<h2> Before you run the program..  </h2>

Included in the github folder is the csv file "iris.csv" along with 3 x .jpg image files (Iris_setosa.jpg, Iris_versicolor.jpg and Iris_virginica.jpg)
These files must be downloaded and saved locally to your hard drive(or any drive). The file path then needs to be changed in the analysis.py program 

for iris.csv - line 38 
data = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\shane\\Desktop\\pands\\pands-project\\iris.csv")

for .jpg files - line 69-71 (inside description() function)
image1 = Image.open("C:\\Users\\shane\\Desktop\\pands\\pands-project\\Iris_setosa.jpg")
image2 = Image.open("C:\\Users\\shane\\Desktop\\pands\\pands-project\\Iris_versicolor.jpg")
